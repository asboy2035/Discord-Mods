# Discord-Mods

For full documentation, go to [my Guides page](https://guides.asboy2035.com/themes/web/discordThemes).

A collection of home-made Discord CSS mods for the redesigned Discord desktop client.

Note: You will need a Discord client mod to use these styles. Check out [Vencord](https://vencord.dev).

1. ## Transparency
    ```

    ```
    
    This theme provides transparency to the Discord UI. Also, be sure to check out Demureify and Semi-transparent main
    that were designed to improve this theme.
    > Note: You can get translucency on macOS with [Vencord](https://vencord.dev).
