# Discord-Mods
A collection of home-made Discord CSS mods for the redesigned Discord desktop client.

Note: You will need a Discord client mod to use these styles. Check out [Vencord](vencord.dev).

1. ### [Transparency](https://github.com/asboy2035/Discord-Mods/raw/refs/heads/main/Transparency.css)
   This theme provides transparency to the Discord UI. You can toggle the transparency on the sidebar and main page/chats.

   Note: You can get translucency on macOS with [Vencord](vencord.dev).

2. ## [Beeg GIF Picker](https://github.com/asboy2035/Discord-Mods/raw/refs/heads/main/Big-GIF-Emoji-Sticker-Picker.css)
   This theme makes your GIF/Emoji/Stickers picker take up most of the screen.
